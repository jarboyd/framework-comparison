# Framework Comparison

To compare the four most popular JS/TS frameworks I will create the same simple todo app in each framework. All implementations will adhere to clean architecture principles, as well as use the same backend API, which will be a simple express.js app using mongodb to store data. For design, all implementations will use Tailwind and DaisyUI, maybe even with components that work for all frameworks, if that is possible.

## First framework: React/Next

React is probably the most popular framework amongst the four, and Next.js is basically just React plus a router (and some SSR features etc.).

## Second framework: Vue/Nuxt

Again, like with React, Nuxt is an Vue extended by a router and other tools.

## Third framework: Svelte/SvelteKit

SvelteKit is also an extension of Svelte adding router functionalities and other tools.

## Fourth framework: Angular

Other than the previous frameworks, Angular comes with its own router and is also opinionated in other regards, meaning the developer has less influence on core principles, which limits individuality, but encourages a robust and comparable overall structure for all projects using Angular.

## Todo and further thoughts

As time goes on I will add pros/cons and other findings about all four frameworks.
